## Application Architecture

This project utilizes a **Three-Tier architecture** to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### Frontend (Client-Side)
Built using **React/Angular/HTML & JavaScript**.  
Responsible for user interactions, displaying real-time data, and ensuring a fast, responsive UI/UX.  
Communicates with the Backend API via RESTful endpoints.

### Backend (Server-Side)
Implemented using **Java**.  
Handles business logic, data validation, and security (authentication and authorization).  
Provides necessary API endpoints consumed by the frontend.

### Database (Data-Tier)
Utilizes **MySQL** to securely manage all transactional data, including guest profiles, reservations, room status, and financial records.
